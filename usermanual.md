## Controls
### Starting the Game
Enter *B* to start the game after the starting text comes up. After that, enter *E*, *M*, or *H* for Easy, Medium, or Hard difficulty.
The map is bigger, health is smaller, and bonus points greater for harder difficulties. Entering *D* will put you in debug mode giving you a full map and the location of the exit. 

*Be careful! On Hard, some enemies can defeat you in one fight!*
### Moving Around the Map
You can move in four directions- up, down, left, and right. Each time you enter a room, you will be prompted on which way(s) you can go.
Enter *w* to go up, *s* to go down, *a* to go left,  and *d* to go right. 
You can look at your map with *m*. This will show you what rooms you've been too and which ones are waiting to be explored.
You can examine your inventory with *i* and use an item with *u*.
### Combat
Combat starts when you enter an enemy room. You can fight with *f* or retreat with *r*. If you run away, the enemy will stay in the room.
If you fight, you take the first move. Use *n* to attack, *i* to use an item, and *r* to retreat. If you kill an enemy, you get 5000 points.

*Dying is bad. If you lose all of your health, you die and the game ends immediately!*
